The past and future of science is open

Scientific ideals, methods, and mores have developed substantially over the 
past century, and these have contributed to unprecedented advances in knowledge 
and understanding across an astonishing array of fields. In this talk, I will
argue that openness, as an attitude and a set of specific practices, has been 
critical for these successes and will continue to be so in the future. In so 
doing, I will share some personal experiences on the open science frontier drawn
from my work co-founding Databrary, editing manuscripts for Nature Scientific Data, 
publishing research openly, and teaching courses and workshops on open scholarship.
