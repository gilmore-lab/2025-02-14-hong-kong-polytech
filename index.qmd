# Reflections

## Why is this so funny?

## Why is it *not* so funny?

## @Begley2012-cr

::: {.incremental}
- "...Scientists in the haematology and oncology department at the biotechnology firm Amgen...tried to confirm published findings...[from] fifty-three...'landmark' studies..."
- "...findings were confirmed in only 6 (11%) cases."
- Even knowing the limitations of preclinical research, this was a shocking result.
- "Raise standards for clinical research"
:::

## @Errington2021-dp

>We conducted the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology to investigate the replicability of preclinical research in cancer biology. The initial aim of the project was to repeat 193 experiments from 53 high-impact papers...However, the various barriers and challenges we encountered while designing and conducting the experiments meant that we were only able to repeat 50 experiments from 23 papers.

## @Errington2021-dp

::: {.incremental}
- "...data needed to compute effect sizes and conduct power analyses was publicly accessible for just 4 of 193 experiments. Moreover, despite contacting the authors of the original
papers, we were unable to obtain these data for 68% of the experiments." 
- "None of the 193 experiments were described in sufficient detail in the original paper to enable us to design protocols to repeat the experiments." **Fifty percent of authors** were minimally or not at all helpful."
:::

## @Errington2021-dp

- "67% of the peer-reviewed protocols required modifications to complete the research and just 41% of those modifications could be implemented."

::: {.incremental}
- This experience draws attention to a basic and fundamental concern about replication – it is hard to assess whether reported findings are credible."

## What does it convey?

::: {.incremental}
- We can do better
- Much, much better
- So, let's do that
:::

# A better approach

## Openness

- Share data, code, materials, & protocols
  - Openly (no prior approval or mandated collaboration)
  - With explicit permission, formal data use agreements
- Publish replications and null findings
- Re-use and cite what others have shared

>The persistence of false findings can be meliorated with strategies that make the fundamental but abstract accuracy motive--**getting it right**--competitive with the more tangible and concrete incentive—getting it published.
